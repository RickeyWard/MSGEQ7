    This is the GitHub source code repository for a MSGEQ7 7-band graphic equalizer sample app for Arduino.  

    In this folder are:
    1. README - this file
    2. MSGEQ7-schematic.png - the hardware schematic for the MSGEQ7 breakout board
    3. MSGEQ7_Demo.ino - the Arduino sample code for driving the MSGEQ7

    Breakout boards are available on eBay.  Please buy them and support my open-source efforts!

-New stuff-

This library was created for my own use, and thus is provided with no waranty.
This code was based on code provided on an ebay listing of how to use the MSGEQ7
stereo module originally written by Peter Easton for Whizoo. The code has changed since
and has been modified into a library for easy use and for code simplification.

I wanted to share it with others incase they are interested.
