This is the GitHub source code repository for a MSGEQ7 7-band graphic equalizer sample app for Arduino.  

In this folder are:
1. README - this file
2. MSGEQ7-schematic.png - the hardware schematic for the MSGEQ7 breakout board
3. MSGEQ7_Demo.ino - the Arduino sample code for driving the MSGEQ7

Breakout boards are available on eBay.  Please buy them and support my open-source efforts!
